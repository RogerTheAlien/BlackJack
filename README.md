# BlackJack



this is my Hello-world

I wrote this code as part of an online python learning course.

The programme functions as intended and meets the assignment requirements. 

However, still a lot of room for improvement;
- can remember the score betwen games
- update the display a little (while keeping text based)
- add the advanced blackjack options
- randomise the dealer's behaviour a bit more rather than sticking to <17 or not condition
- ...


Oh and this is my first proper repository.
